# louis-work

## Introduction

Louis-work is a letters game I created for my son as an exercise in learning
modern C++ (>= C++17).

It is built upon [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org), utilises the
[eSpeak NG](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng) speech synthesizer
(cool), [polymorphic_value](https://github.com/jbcoe/polymorphic_value)
for a polymorphic value-type (life-saver) and [conan](https://conan.io/) for
package management (super-easy).

## Installation
